Over my many years I have accumulated a lot of hobbies. I don't have the focus or concentration to get really good at one thing, instead I'm crap at many things. As time went on it became difficult to remember all the hobbies I've tried. To mitigate this I decided to start chronicalling my adventures. Almost three years after I made that decision I finally set this site up.
